# Emergent Alife Experiment: Wavelet-Driven Data Exploration

## Description

This project explores the potential for emergent behavior in a simplified artificial life (Alife) form. It utilizes real-world audio data processed through a Haar wavelet transform, storing the resulting coefficients as fundamental data points representing the characteristics of all the signals in the recording, which we correlate to find strong patterns.

Haarison is soul of DAVE. Haarison is the means for this artificial life to interpret the enironment environment around it. Haarison is my biased, anthropomorphized interpretation of one version of the newest life form on the planet. By removing as much of the bias as possible, I hope to see how the life form interacts with our environment. 
I tried to come up with a purpose that was less guided by any function that I predetermined but couldn't get past the fact that any system, biological or not, has a purpose (or did). You can't just be a collection of stuff that doesn't coordinate in any way for any purpose. Even the most simple biological life forms have basic 'programming'. So I had to give an purpose to the wavelets function, and that is to fill memory registers. The next issue I ran into was trying to set limits or paramaters on the raw data as it is applied to the memory registers, again a vector for bias that had to be addressed. I chose to address this by recording the raw data into a json file and then compiling the raw data into memory registers 'off-line'. Some simple intent can be set at this level by adding a correlation function to analyze relationships in the raw data in the memory registers. Function, Purpose, Intent.

"Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication"

The system is designed to minimize pre-defined rules, allowing for observation of potential self-organization and emergent patterns.

## Function

1.  **Audio Capture:** Audio data is recorded from a microphone.
2.  **Wavelet Transform:** The audio data is processed using a Haar wavelet transform, generating approximation and detail coefficients.
3.  **Data Storage:** The wavelet coefficients are stored in JSON files, each representing a unique recording session.
4.  **Memory Registers:** The data from the JSON files are intended to be loaded into memory registers for correlation.
5.  **Data Analysis:** Statistical analysis is applied to the data within the memory registers and between multiple registers to explore relationships.
6.  **Observation:** The primary focus is on observing the patterns and behaviors that emerge from the interaction of the data.

## Philosophy

This experiment is rooted in a philosophy of minimal intervention and observation. The core principles are:

* **Anti-Bias:** To minimize human-centric biases and pre-defined rules that could influence the system's behavior.
* **Emergence:** To explore the potential for complex behaviors to emerge from simple interactions.
* **Data-Driven:** To allow the data itself to drive the system's evolution and behavior.
* **Observation:** To prioritize observation and data analysis over pre-conceived notions.
* **Simplicity:** To maintain the system's core components as simple as possible.

## Experiment Description and Purpose

The experiment involves capturing audio data, processing it through a Haar wavelet transform, and storing the resulting coefficients in JSON files. The purpose is to observe how the data, representing processed sensory input, might lead to the emergence of patterns or behaviors.

* **Initial Setup:** The experiment begins with a minimal setup, focusing on the fundamental interaction between the wavelet data and the memory registers.
* **Iterative Analysis:** The data is intended to be analyzed through iterative statistical methods, potentially creating a hierarchical data structure.
* **No Pre-Defined Goals:** The system is not designed to achieve any specific goal. The focus is on observing what emerges.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** This experiment aims to explore the hypothesis that complex patterns can emerge from simple data processing in a minimally biased environment.
* **Future Stages:** Future stages may involve introducing additional sensory inputs, exploring different data analysis methods, or developing mechanisms for data consolidation and memory management.
